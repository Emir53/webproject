      <h3>Method Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The night before you want to start the bread, make a poolish (starter). Put the strong wholemeal flour, 50g water and a pinch of the yeast in a small container. Mix, cover and leave at room temperature overnight until bubbly.</li>
        <li>The next day, scrape the poolish into a large mixing bowl and add the white flour, remaining yeast, sugar and water. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the salt with a splash of water to help it dissolve and knead into the dough, followed by the olive oil. Cover and set aside for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>‘Coil fold’ the dough: use wet hands to scoop under one edge of the dough, lift it up then fold it over itself. Turn the bowl by a quarter and repeat, then turn and repeat twice more. Cover and set aside for 40 minutes. Repeat this 4 more times, every 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once you’ve completed the final fold and rest, line the baking tin with baking paper then drizzle a little olive oil in the base and spread it out with your fingers. Carefully persuade the dough into the tin and gently ease it out towards the sides, so it’s roughly rectangular and of an even thickness. To do this use your fingertips underneath the dough, but don’t push or pull too firmly. It may not reach the edges of the tin but don’t worry – it will puff up and fill out as it proves. Cover with a clean tea towel and put in the fridge to prove overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, take the dough out of the fridge to come to room temperature (about 30 minutes). Heat the oven to 200°C fan/gas</li>
        <li>Oil your fingers and press them down into the dough to create a dimple pattern all over the top. Open the tin of anchovies, drizzle over the oil they’re stored in, then scatter the anchovies over the top, followed by the olives, capers, tomatoes and garlic. Drizzle over plenty more olive oil, scatter with sea salt, then bake for 15 minutes. Turn the heat down to 180°C fan/gas 6 without opening the oven and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool or eat while still warm.</li>
