      <h2>Black bean and chicken burritos</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Bunch spring onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>400g tin black beans in water, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>100g cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 large avocado</li>
        <li>Juice 1 lime</li>
        <li>1 red chilli, finely chopped</li>
        <li>150g ripe cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, reserving a few whole leaves to serve</li>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>125g cooked chicken, shredded</li>
        <li>100g mild cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>Hot sauce such as Tabasco or Cholula to serve (optional)</li>






      </ul>
      <h3>Method Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the spring onions and cook for 3-4 minutes until beginning to soften. Stir in the garlic and cumin, cook for just a minute longer, then add the drained beans and paprika and cook for a further 3 minutes. Add a splash of water to the pan and, with a fork or potato masher, mash the beans until you have a coarse paste. Season to taste, then stir in the rice and remove from the heat.</li>    
        <li>Scoop the avocado into a bowl and mash well with a fork, adding the lime juice as you go. Stir in the chopped chilli, tomatoes and coriander, then season to taste.</li>
        <li>Warm a flour tortilla in a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Put it on a chopping board, then spread a few tablespoons of the black bean and rice mixture in the centre. Spoon a quarter of the avocado mixture on top, then sprinkle on a quarter each of the chicken and the cheese and a few reserved coriander leaves. Roll up the tortilla tightly, tucking in the ends. Lay seam-side down on the chopping board, then prepare the other tortillas. Serve with hot sauce, if you like.</li>
