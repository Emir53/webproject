      <h2>Black bean chilli soup with corn dumplings</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>300ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>250g undyed smoked haddock, skinned</li>
        <li>350g floury potatoes (such as maris piper or king edward), peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 large mango, peeled, stoned and diced into 1cm cubes</li>
        <li>1 small red chilli, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Bunch (25g) coriander, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Finely grated zest and juice 1 lime</li>
        <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Bunch spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium free-range egg, beaten</li>
        <li>30g panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 little gem lettuces, finely shredded</li>
        <li>12 small corn or flour tacos</li>
      </ul>

     
      <h3>Method Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and add the smoked haddock, then gently poach for 3-4 minutes until cooked through and flaky. Lift the fish out of the milk with a slotted spoon, then set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Put the potatoes in the leftover milk, topping up with water to cover (if needed). Bring to the boil and simmer for 10-12 minutes until very tender. Drain in a colander and set aside to steam dry.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the mango with the chilli, half the coriander and half the lime juice. Season with a pinch of salt and mix well. Mix the remaining lime juice with the mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Put the spring onions, lime zest and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Add the potatoes with a pinch of salt and mash everything together until well combined. Flake in the fish, add half the remaining coriander, then stir until you have a dry, firm mixture. Shape into small 3-4cm patties, laying them on a tray as you work. You should get around 24 in total.</li>
        <li>Put the beaten egg in one shallow dish and the breadcrumbs in another. Heat a good glug of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. One by one, dip the fishcakes in the egg, then the breadcrumbs, then put them straight into the frying pan (you’ll need to work in batches, adding more oil as needed). Cook for 2 minutes on each side until golden and crisp, then drain on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>To serve, sprinkle shredded lettuce onto each taco. Top with 2 fishcakes, then a spoonful of lime mayonnaise. Finish with the mango salsa and a pinch of the remaining coriander.</li>
