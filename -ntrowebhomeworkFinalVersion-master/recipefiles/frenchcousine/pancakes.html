      <h2>Buckwheat pancakes</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>15g fast-action dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 litre whole milk or water, or 500ml milk mixed with 500ml water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>250g buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>250g wholemeal or plain flour</li>
        <li>1 medium free-range egg</li>
        <li>20g unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus plenty extra to fry</li>
        <li>10g sea salt</li>
        <li>250g mature gouda or cheddar, grated</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Method Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pour the yeast in a bowl and mix with half the milk/water. Combine both flours in a separate bowl, then make a well in the centre and add the egg, followed by the yeast mixture and butter. Stir to incorporate, then gradually add the remaining milk/water, stirring until smooth. Stir in the salt, cover the bowl with a tea towel and set aside to rest for 1 hour (or refrigerate overnight).</li>
        <li>Put a frying pan over a medium heat and add a generous amount of butter. Add a ladleful or two of the batter and cook for a few minutes until solid. I tend to use a 20cm frying pan and add 40ml batter for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Once you have 2 cooked pancakes, scatter some grated cheese over one, leaving a 1cm border around the edge, then put the second pancake on top (like a sandwich). Set aside and continue making pancakes, sandwiching them together with cheese, until all the batter and cheese is used up.</li>
        <li>Refrying is essential to obtain the crisp exterior of the pancake; we don’t want soggy pancakes, we want crispy crêpes! To refry, add some more butter to the pan, then put a filled pair of pancakes in it and cook for 2 minutes, turning halfway, until crisp.</li>
