      <h2>Vichyssoise</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 leek, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely sliced</li>
        <li>250g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm chunks</li>
        <li>600ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>100g crème fraîche</li>
        <li>100g whole milk</li>
        <li>Squeeze lemon juice, to taste</li>
        <li>4 tbsp mixed nuts and seeds, toasted, to serve</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil to serve</li>






      </ul>
      <h3>Method Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat, then add the leek and garlic. Cook slowly with a pinch of salt for about 8 minutes until softening, then add the potatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring regularly to avoid browning anything. Pour in the stock, throw in the bay leaf and leave to simmer gently for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Discard the bay leaf, then use a stick blender or transfer to a jug blender and whizz until very smooth – take your time ensuring it’s as creamy as possible. Stir in the crème fraîche, then add the milk bit by bit until the soup has the consistency of double cream (you may not need all the milk). Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste, then transfer to a jug or bowl, cover and chill (ideally overnight).</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the chilled soup among bowls and top with the toasted nuts and seeds. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
      </ol>
